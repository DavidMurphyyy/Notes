#  Functionality:
#  This application was created as a simple to use application for a user to create notes with titles and descriptions.
#  Along with this the user is shown a sleek startup screen, which they must use a button click to open into the main app.
#  Once the user has created their note they can view all saved notes on a list, along with this they can re-access the notes,
#  edit them as they please, and cancel their edits via a button on the top right "Cancel Note".
